# Webpage with GitHub

## Help

- [Questions to this exercise](http://askbot.greenfox.academy/questions/tags:github-io/)

## Step by step

- Create a new repository with the name convention like: ***your-github-name.github.io***
  - Where `your-github-name` should be your username on GitHub, mine would look like this for example: `adamgyulavari.github.io`
- Publish your repository and make sure to untick *Keep this code private*
- Copy the content of the website what you made at `My first website` workshop day
  - Just the `dist` folder's content, so an `index.html` and the `style.css` should be in the folder
- Commit your changes and push origin
- Now you can check ***your-github-name.github.io*** in your browser, and send everyone what you made before :)
- Make some change, push again, and check the differences
  - It usually takes a while for GitHub to update the content, so don't be afraid if it doesn't appear immediately
